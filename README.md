# really-basic-python-cheat-sheet-template
A simple latex template for python cheatsheets, using the BaPoster class. Most cheat sheet templates have a lot of extra stuff in them that makes them difficult to read and reuse. This one is ready to go!

# Important documents:
* main.tex: the template
* baposter.cls: the latex class for baposter

# How to use
The easiest way to use these would be to load `main.tex` and `baposter.cls` into an overleaf project and start editing. The compiler is `pdfLaTeX` and the TeXLive version is 2021.
